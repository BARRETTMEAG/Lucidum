Treefile Overview: 

- ML_not_ is rooted, has posterior values with equal branching. This phylogenic tree shows how tree branches vary value wise. SH-aLRT support (%) / aBayes support / ultrafast bootstrap support (%) are shown. This is the only tree that has better branching compared to other trees. This shows three support values, although the branch's use cladogram for equal branching. This tree is the best. 


- Treefile is showing what the tree looks like before the values and cladogram are used. 

- Colored.treefile shows a colored tree according to the posterior values. 

- Cladogram_branch_posterior tree uses cladogram to make the branches equal, dispite not truely being "equal". The rule of thumb is that the longer the branch value is the more evolutionary changes there are. 

- Non_cladogram_branch tree shows the opposite of Cladogram_branch_posterior, it shows that Homo_sapiens is the branch with the most evolutionary changes. This data needs to be double checked, since there is potential for errors human, computing, or even genetic.

Disclaimer:

- These trees are the best attempts made to make sense of the data and are thus prone to potential errors.
