Final Project folder contains Final SM, this has information and pictures from the different files that were used: NGPhylogeny, Beauti-Beast, iqtree, R, etc. 

SM tree data contains the fasta file and name of the final taxa. 



Disclaimer:

  Despite multiple attempts to group certain organisms in the same group, issues would arise in R, Beauti-Beast, and NGPhylogeny causing the trees to take incorrect shapes. 

  The trees in this final SM are the best attempts made, it may not be correct due multiple factors: the DNA sequences, incomplete alignments, incorrect alignments, human error, etc. 
  
  Our lucidum group did the best we could with the data that we have.
