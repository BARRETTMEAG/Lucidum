SuperMatrix Overview: 

- Before_Resolving: this was the supermatrix while there was still homo_sapien in the fasta file, as can be seen in the Draft trees in Beauti-Beast.

- After_Resolving: this is the supermatrix fasta file and taxa list after homo_sapiens. 

- These two folders show trimmed supermatrix files and taxa lists after putting the aligned files into Liger. 

- This is not the final version, it will be trimmed down further.
