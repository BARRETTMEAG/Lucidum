Super CCD0 Picture:

- Supermax_CCD0_MAP.tree.pdf (Tree) shows a rooted tree and does not have posterior values associated.

- Tree1 has posterior values and is also rooted. The values that are close or at 1 indicate that that node is 100 probable. 

- Tree2 shows the branches using cladogram to have equal branch length and aligned names. The posterior numbers are easier to read. This tree is rooted. 

- Tree3 shows a colored version of Tree2. This tree shows the branches being colored according to posterior values, when the branches that are red and black indicates 1, where brown indicates that it is not very accurate.
