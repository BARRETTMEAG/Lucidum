Best Tree Overview:

- Best_tree shows the treefile that was created in iqtree after several attempts, this data is found under Final_SM/SM_iqtree/file_data (this shows the files created by iqtree), SM_iqtree/trees (shows contree and treefile created by iqtree), and the trees/treefile has the treefile that was used to create the tree pictures. 

- ML_not_ is rooted, has posterior values with equal branching. This phylogenic tree shows how tree branches vary value wise. SH-aLRT support (%) / aBayes support / ultrafast bootstrap support (%) are shown.


- This is the only tree that has better branching compared to other trees. This shows three support values, although the branch's use cladogram for equal branching. This tree is the best. 


- Treefile is to showing what the tree looks like before the values and cladogram are used. 

- Colored.treefile shows that this tree would look like if you colored it according to the posterior values.
