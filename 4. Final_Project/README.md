Final Project Overview:

- Final Project folder contains Final SM, this has information and pictures from the different files that were used: NGPhylogeny, Beauti-Beast, iqtree, R, etc. 

- SM tree data contains the fasta file and name of the final taxa. 



- Disclaimer:
 - Despite multiple attempts to group certain organisms in the same group and in a certain order, issues would arise in R, Beauti-Beast, and NGPhylogeny causing the trees to take incorrect shapes.
  - The trees in this final SM are the best attempts made, it may not be correct due multiple factors: the DNA sequences having errors, incomplete alignments, incorrect alignments, human errors, etc., despite attempts made to counterattach these situations, the trees still are not perfect.
  - Our lucidum group did the best we could with the data that we have.
