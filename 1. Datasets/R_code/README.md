R code steps:

- 1st- Dataset_template pulled data for the different genes. Some of the names in the code were changed after many attempts.

- 2nd- Alignments_data is timmed and aligned gene data. Some of the names in the code were changed after many attempts.

- 3rd- Between Alignments and Core, Liger (a computer program Andrew Budge created (https://github.com/andrewbudge/Liger.)) was used to create the supermatrix.

- 4th- Core_region was used for the trimming the supermatrix.
