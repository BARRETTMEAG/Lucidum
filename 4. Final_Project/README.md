4. Final Project Overview:

 - Final SM contains information and pictures from NGPhylogeny, iqtree, and R. 

 - SM tree data contains the fasta file and name of the final taxa.

 - Best Tree contains the final_tree that is best among all the other trees. Also, the Contree and Treefile files are found in Contree:Treefile_Files and their pictures are found in Pictures. 

 - Our Project Presentation is also present: "When we Lost our Shine".
   - This presentation is about how Primates lost the tapetum lucidum in their eyes.    

Disclaimer:
 - Despite multiple attempts to group certain organisms in the same group and certain order, issues would arise in R, Beauti-Beast, and NGPhylogeny causing the trees to take incorrect shapes.
 
  - The trees in this final SM are the best attempts made; it may not be correct due multiple factors: the DNA sequences having errors, incomplete and/or incorrect alignments, human errors, etc., despite attempts made to counterattack these situations, the trees still are not perfect.
 
  - Our lucidum group did the best we could with the data collected.
