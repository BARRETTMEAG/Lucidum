Best Tree Overview:

- Best_tree shows the treefile and contree files and pictures that were created in iqtree after several unsuccessful attempts. Iqtree has proven to be the most useful and less troublesome of all of the other technology/program systems. 


In Pictures: 

- Both Contree and Treefile have better and are more accurate trees compared to trees from R, Beauti-Beast, and NGPhylogeny. When comparing Treefile vs. Contree, there are many similarities. The values are similar, along with the structures. The values may have changed due to errors whether it be human, computer, or genetics.

- The absolute best tree is Treefile's Color_posterior_branch is a rooted colored tree that has the branch length values and is colored according to posterior values, this tree does not use cladogram.

- There is a picture that combined both iqtree's treefile and R, although it does not have the posterior values, but shows the data we wanted for which species have lucidum and which do not (Lucidum.pdf).

- Each tree has it's own individual values. The treefile: cladogram_node_colored does a good job of depicting the posterior values.

- Contree's Branch_length shows a nice picture of a tree with it's branch length values.

- Each of these trees tell a story and there is not just one best tree.
