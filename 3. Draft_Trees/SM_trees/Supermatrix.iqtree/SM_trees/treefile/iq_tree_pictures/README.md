Iq Tree Pictures Overview:

- New_core_region.fasta.treefile.pdf (Treefile) shows a tree that has been rooted and the posterior values associated. This phylogenic tree shows how tree branches can vary. 

- Treefile0 is rooted, has posterior values and is in a circular form with equal branching (using cladogram). 

- Treefile1 has the posterior values with equal branching (using cladogram). The values close to 1 indicate that that node is 100 probable.
