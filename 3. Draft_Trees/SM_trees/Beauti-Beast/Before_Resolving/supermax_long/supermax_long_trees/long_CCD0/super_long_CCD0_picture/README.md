Super Long CCD0 Picture Overview:

- Supermax_long_CCD0_MAP.tree.pdf (Tree) shows a tree that has been rooted without posterior values associated.

- Tree1 has the posterior values that were missing from Tree. The values that are close or at 1 indicate that that node is 100 probable. 

- Tree2 shows the posterior node and bar values. The branches are not equal. 

- Tree3 shows a rooted tree with the posterior probability values along with equal branch length (using cladogram), making it easier to read.

- Tree4 shows a colored version of Tree3. This tree shows the branches being colored according to posterior values, when the branches that are red and black indicates 1, where brown indicates that it is not very accurate.
