SM Trees Overview:

- Contains trees formed from the supermatrix fasta file that was uploaded either into iqtree3 or NGPhylogeny. 

- Almost all of the trees show the maximum likelihood and Baysian, with the exception of the NGphylogeny.

- NGPhy_tree was created by NGPhylogeny, where contree and treefile were created by iqtree.  
These trees are draft trees for the supermatrix. 

- The iqtree (contree, treefile, iqtree) files are also included. 

- Beauti-Beast show the trees created in Beauti and Beast, files and pictures included. 

- The Difference between before and after resolving folders is one previously (Before_Resolving) contains homo_sapiens in the fasta and pictures, thus making the trees not reliable. Whereas After_Resolving has homo_sapiens removed (kept the other homo_sapiens_), the trees are much more reliable.
