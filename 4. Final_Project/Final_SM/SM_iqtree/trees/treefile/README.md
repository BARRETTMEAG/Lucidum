Treefile Overview:

- ML_not_ is rooted, has posterior values with equal branching. This phylogenic tree shows how tree branches vary. This shows the SH-aLRT support (%) / aBayes support / ultrafast bootstrap support (%)


- Treefile shows the treefile that was used to create the trees. 

- Original_before shows the tree before equal branching occurs.
