Tree Overview: 

- RAG2_trimmed.fasta.contree.pdf (Contree) contains a picture of the same tree as NGPhylogeny without values. 

- Contree2 shows these posterior values. Showing the probability of these nodes. 

- Contree3 shows the posterior values of these aligned branches, making it easier to see. 

- Contree4 shows a circular chart with the posterior values and all the branches have been aligned. This is not how they originally look, but this is for being able to read the values more clearly.
