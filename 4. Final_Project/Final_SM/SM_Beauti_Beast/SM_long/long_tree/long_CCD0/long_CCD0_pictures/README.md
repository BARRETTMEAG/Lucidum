Long CCD0 Picture Overview:

- Posterior is rooted, has posterior values without equal branching. This phylogenic tree shows how tree branches vary.

- Posterior_Cladogram is rooted, has posterior values with equal branching. This phylogenic tree shows how tree branches vary.

- Posterior_Color shows a colored version. This tree shows the branches being colored according to posterior values, when the branches that are red and black indicates 1, where brown indicates that it is not very accurate. 

- Tree without the posterior values without equal branching.
