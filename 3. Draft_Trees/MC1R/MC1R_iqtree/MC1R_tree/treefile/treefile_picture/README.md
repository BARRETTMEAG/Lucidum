Tree Overview:

- Treefile1 is rooted, has posterior values without equal branching. This phylogenic tree shows how tree branches can vary.

- Treefile2 has the posterior values with equal branching. 

- Treefile3 is rooted, has posterior values without equal branching. This phylogenic tree shows how tree branches can vary, especially since it is in a circular formation. 

- Treefile4 is rooted, has posterior values with equal branching. This phylogenic tree shows how tree branches can vary, especially since it is in a circular formation.
