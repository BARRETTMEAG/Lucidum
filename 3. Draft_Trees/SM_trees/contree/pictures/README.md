The purpose of contree is to show what the supermatrix tree looks like after running it through iqtree. 

The first Contree, shows the different branches and their values at least how they are "suppose" to be. 

Contree1 has the branches spreadout so that the taxa names and maximum-likelihood values are easier to see.
