Contree Overview:

- Cladogram_posterior show this rooted contree file that has the posterior probability values and is using cladogram to have the branches equal.

- Colored_cladogram is similar to Cladogram_posterior in having posterior probability values and using cladogram, the difference is that this tree is colored according to the values of the posterior probability according to the legend.

- No_cladogram shows this contree without an posterior values and not using cladogram.

- Cladogram_branch_posterior tree uses cladogram to make the branches equal, dispite not truely being "equal". The rule of thumb is that the longer the branch value is the more evolutionary changes.

- Non_cladogram_branch tree shows the opposit of Cladogram_branch_posterior, it shows that Homo_sapiens is the branch with the most evolutionary changes. This data needs to be double checked, since there is potential for errors human, computing, or even genetic.
