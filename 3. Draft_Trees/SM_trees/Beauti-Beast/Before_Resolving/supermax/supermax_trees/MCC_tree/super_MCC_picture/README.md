Super MCC Picture Overview:

- Supermax_MCC.tree.pdf (Tree) shows a rooted tree without posterior values associated.

- Tree1 has posterior values, rooted, without cladogram alignments. The values that are close or at 1 indicate that that node is 100% probable. 

- Tree2 shows the branches being at equal length and the names are aligned. The posterior numbers are easier to read. This tree is rooted. 

- Tree3 shows a circular, rooted diagram using cladogram and posterior numbering. 

- Tree4 shows a colored version of Tree1. This tree shows the branches being colored according to posterior values, when branches are red and black colored indicates 1, where brown indicates not very accurate values.
