New_core_region.fasta.treefile.pdf (Treefile) shows a tree that has been rooted and the posterior values associated. This phylogenic tree shows how tree branches can vary. 

Treefile0 is rooted, has posterior values and is in a circular form with equal branching. 

Treefile1 has the posterior values with equal branching. The values that are close or at 1 indicate that that node is 100 probable.
