SM CCDO Picture Overview:

- Posterior is rooted, has posterior values without cladogram branching. This phylogenic tree shows how tree branches vary.

- Tree is shown without the posterior values without cladogram branching. 

- Tree_node_bar is rooted, has posterior values without cladogram branching. This phylogenic tree shows how tree branches vary. This also has a bar node. 

- Colored_branch shows a colored version. This tree shows cladogram branches colored according to posterior values, when the branches that are red and black indicates 1, where brown indicates that it is not very accurate.
