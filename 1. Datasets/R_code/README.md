R code steps:

1st- Dataset_template is how we pulled our data for the different genes.

2nd- Alignments_data is how we timmed and aligned the data of the genes.

3rd- Between Alignments and Core, Liger (a computer program Andrew Budge created (https://github.com/andrewbudge/Liger.)) was used to create the supermatrix.

4th- Core_region was used for the trimming the supermatrix.
