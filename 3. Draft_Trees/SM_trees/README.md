This is a tree formed from the supermatrix fasta file that was uploaded either into iqtree3 or NGPhylogeny, to show these trees. 
Almost all of the trees show the maximum likelihood, with the exception of the NGphylogeny.
NGPhy_tree was created by NGPhylogeny, where contree and treefile were created by iqtree.  
These trees are draft trees for the supermatrix. 

The iqtree file is also included.
