MCC Picture Overview: 

- Node_bar is rooted, has posterior values without cladogram branching. This phylogenic tree shows how tree branches vary. This also has a bar node. 

- Posterior  is rooted, has posterior values without cladogram branching. This phylogenic tree shows how tree branches vary.

- Posterior_Cladogram is rooted, has posterior values without cladogram branching. This phylogenic tree shows how tree branches vary.

- Posterior_Color shows a colored version. This tree shows the branches being colored according to posterior values, branches that are red and black indicates 1, where brown indicates that it is not very accurate. 

- Tree shows no posterior values and is without cladogram branching.
