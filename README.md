This project aims to identify which species among primates (50 taxa) possess or lack tapetum lucidum. The genes that we are using are: IRBP, MC1R, RAG2, Mitochondria, and G6PD.

The folder Datasets contains: raw data for different species that our group has gathered. 

The Alignments folder alignment contains the genetics after trimming and aligning in R. 
SuperMatrix contains the alignment of all of the taxa.
